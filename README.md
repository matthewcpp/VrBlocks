# VR Blocks
Vr Blocks is a lightweight set of components that are useful for creating simple VR experiences in Unity using the native XR API.


### Configuration
Currently the sample scene materials are setup to use the LWRP.  If you load it into projects which are configured with other rendering pipelines, the materials may not display correctly.

Download this repository as a zip and extract it into the `Assets` folder of your project.
In `Build Settings -> Player -> XR Settings`: Ensure that `Virtual Reality Supported` is checked.
Ensure that the `XR Legacy Input Helpers` package is installed from the Package Manager.
